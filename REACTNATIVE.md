React Native is primarily used to build mobile applications for both iOS and Android using JavaScript. It allows developers to create cross-platform apps with a single codebase, significantly reducing development time and cost compared to native development. Essentially, it leverages the power of React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces) and combines it with native components to create high-performance, natively rendered mobile apps.
