Expo is primarily used as a framework and platform to simplify and accelerate the development of cross-platform mobile and web applications using React Native. It provides tools, libraries, and services that make it easier to build, test, deploy, and manage apps across iOS, Android, and the web. Essentially, Expo acts as a bridge between React Native and the complexities of native mobile development, offering a streamlined workflow and a rich set of pre-built components and APIs.
