Django REST Framework (DRF) is a powerful toolkit used to build Web APIs with Django. It simplifies the process of creating, testing, and maintaining RESTful APIs by providing features like serialization, authentication, and request/response handling. Essentially, it allows you to expose your Django application's data and functionality to other applications, websites, or mobile apps through a standardized interface.
