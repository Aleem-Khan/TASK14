The Sanity SDK, specifically the App SDK, is used to build custom applications that interact with Sanity.io content in real-time. It provides React hooks and data stores, allowing developers to create tailored content experiences and manage content within their own applications. This enables teams to develop custom interfaces for content creation, management, and workflow automation, beyond the capabilities of the standard Sanity Studio.
